<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.0839v1.pdf>Etude mcanique des articles de contention et de leurs effets sur la
  jambe humaine. Mechanical investigation of compression stockings and of their
  effects on the human leg</a></h2>
<p>  This paper presents a synthesis of different studies willing to bring a
scientific insight into leg compression, which is the process of applying
external compression forces onto the human leg with stockings or socks, for
enhancing the venous flow. It seems obvious that the pressure distribution on
the leg affects the blood flow in the veins. However, the pressure distribution
that leads to the optimal blood flow is not trivial, and it is different with
regard to the application: medical treatment or recovering after an effort in
sports. In order to improve the scientific knowledge about this topic, a
numerical 2D model was set up for computing stress fields inside the leg,
accounting for the actual material properties of both the compression stocking
and of the leg biological tissues. Suitable identification methods, based
either on model updating from digital image correlation (for the compression
stockings), or on image warping and model updating from MRI scans (for the
internal leg tissues), were developed for retrieving these material properties.

<p>  We present the Pantheon 1.0 dataset: a manually verified dataset of
individuals that have transcended linguistic, temporal, and geographic
boundaries. The Pantheon 1.0 dataset includes the 11,341 biographies present in
more than 25 languages in Wikipedia and is enriched with: (i) manually verified
demographic information (place and date of birth, gender) (ii) a taxonomy of
occupations classifying each biography at three levels of aggregation and (iii)
two measures of global popularity including the number of languages in which a
biography is present in Wikipedia (L), and the Historical Popularity Index
(HPI) a metric that combines information on L, time since birth, and page-views
(2008-2013). We compare the Pantheon 1.0 dataset to data from the 2003 book,
Human Accomplishments, and also to external measures of accomplishment in
individual games and sports: Tennis, Swimming, Car Racing, and Chess. In all of
these cases we find that measures of popularity (L and HPI) correlate highly
with individual accomplishment, suggesting that measures of global popularity
proxy the historical impact of individuals.

<p>  From sporting events to sociological surveys, ranking from pairwise
comparisons is a tool of choice for many applications. When certain pairs of
items are difficult to compare, outcomes can be noisy, and it is necessary to
develop robust strategies. In this work, we show how a simple active sampling
scheme that uses a standard black box sorting algorithm enables the efficient
recovery of the ranking, achieving low error with sparse samples. Both in
theory and practice, this active strategy performs systematically better than
selecting comparisons at random. As a detour, we show a link between Rank
Centrality, a recently proposed algorithm for rank aggregation, and the ML
estimator for the Bradley-Terry model. This enables us to develop a new,
provably convergent iterative algorithm for computing the ML estimate.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0251v2.pdf>Capturing Variation and Uncertainty in Human Judgment</a></h2>
<p>  The well-studied problem of statistical rank aggregation has been applied to
comparing sports teams, information retrieval, and most recently to data
generated by human judgment. Such human-generated rankings may be substantially
different from traditional statistical ranking data. In this work, we show that
a recently proposed generalized random utility model reveals distinctive
patterns in human judgment across three different domains, and provides a
succinct representation of variance in both population preferences and
imperfect perception. In contrast, we also show that classical statistical
ranking models fail to capture important features from human-generated input.
Our work motivates the use of more flexible ranking models for representing and
describing the collective preferences or decision-making of human participants.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.07939v1.pdf>Labor Disputes and Worker Productivity</a></h2>
<p>  We implement a propensity score matching technique to present the first
evidence on the impact of labor supply decisions during labor disputes on
worker productivity in the context of professional sports. In particular, we
utilize a unique natural experiment from the 2012-13 National Hockey League
(NHL) lockout, during which approximately 200 players decided to play overseas
while the rest stayed in North America. We separate the players based on their
nationality and investigate the effect of playing abroad on post-lockout player
performance. We find limited evidence of enhanced productivity among European
players, and no evidence of a benefit or drawback for North American players.
The lack of consistent productivity impact is in line with literature in
industries with large labor rents, and we propose several additional
explanations within the context of professional hockey. Our study contributes
to the general understanding of the impact of employer-initiated work stoppage
on labor productivity.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1243v1.pdf>Using Twitter to predict football outcomes</a></h2>
<p>  Twitter has been proven to be a notable source for predictive modelling on
various domains such as the stock market, the dissemination of diseases or
sports outcomes. However, such a study has not been conducted in football
(soccer) so far. The purpose of this research was to study whether data mined
from Twitter can be used for this purpose. We built a set of predictive models
for the outcome of football games of the English Premier League for a 3 month
period based on tweets and we studied whether these models can overcome
predictive models which use only historical data and simple football
statistics. Moreover, combined models are constructed using both Twitter and
historical data. The final results indicate that data mined from Twitter can
indeed be a useful source for predicting games in the Premier League. The final
Twitter-based model performs significantly better than chance when measured by
Cohen's kappa and is comparable to the model that uses simple statistics and
historical data. Combining both models raises the performance higher than it
was achieved by each individual model. Thereby, this study provides evidence
that Twitter derived features can indeed provide useful information for the
prediction of football (soccer) outcomes.

  Generalized Linear Mixed Models with Non-nested, Correlated Random Effects</a></h2>
<p>  Estimation of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with non-nested random
effects structures requires approximation of high-dimensional integrals. Many
existing methods are tailored to the low-dimensional integrals produced by
nested designs. We explore the modifications that are required in order to
adapt an EM algorithm with first-order and fully exponential Laplace
approximations to a non-nested, multiple response model. The equations in the
estimation routine are expressed as functions of the first four derivatives of
the conditional likelihood of an arbitrary GLMM, providing a template for
future applications. We apply the method to a joint Poisson-binary model for
ranking sporting teams, and discuss the estimation of a correlated random
effects model designed to evaluate the sensitivity of value-added models for
teacher evaluation to assumptions about the missing data process. Source code

<p>  We propose a macroscopic model in form of a dispersion-transport equation for
non-congested flow of the athletes which is coupled to a kinematic-wave model
for congested flow. The model takes into account the performance (i.e.,
free-flow speed distributions) of the athletes in the different starting
groups. The model is calibrated and validated on data of the German
$\textit{Rennsteig Half Marathon 2012}$ and the Swedish $\textit{Vasaloppet
2012}$ cross-country ski race. Simulations of the model allow the event
managers to improve the organization by determining the optimum number of
starting groups, the maximum size of each group, whether a wave start with a
certain starting delay between the groups is necessary, or what will be the
effects of changing the course. We apply the model to simulate a planned course
change for the Rennsteig Half Marathon 2013, and determine whether critical

  Problems</a></h2>
<p>  Designing a search heuristic for constraint programming that is reliable
across problem domains has been an important research topic in recent years.
This paper concentrates on one family of candidates: counting-based search.
Such heuristics seek to make branching decisions that preserve most of the
solutions by determining what proportion of solutions to each individual
constraint agree with that decision. Whereas most generic search heuristics in
constraint programming rely on local information at the level of the individual
variable, our search heuristics are based on more global information at the
constraint level. We design several algorithms that are used to count the
number of solutions to specific families of constraints and propose some search
heuristics exploiting such information. The experimental part of the paper
considers eight problem domains ranging from well-established benchmark puzzles
to rostering and sport scheduling. An initial empirical analysis identifies
heuristic maxSD as a robust candidate among our proposals.eWe then evaluate the
latter against the state of the art, including the latest generic search
heuristics, restarts, and discrepancy-based tree traversals. Experimental
results show that counting-based search generally outperforms other generic
heuristics.

kicking of the bicycle kick of sepak takraw game. Sepak takraw is a highly
complex net-barrier kicking sport that involves dazzling displays of quick
reflexes, acrobatic twists, turns and swerves of the agile human body movement.
A Bicycle kick or Scissor kick is a physical move made by throwing the body up
into the air, making a shearing movement with the legs to get one leg in front
of the other without holding on to the ground. Specifically, this paper
considers bicycle kick of sepak takraw game in start kicking of the ball with
uncertainty where player has different awareness regarding the contingencies.
We have chosen Dempster-Shafer theory because the advantages of the
Dempster-Shafer theory which include the ability to model information in a
flexible way without requiring a probability to be assigned to each element in
a set, providing a convenient and simple mechanism for combining two or more
pieces of evidence under certain conditions, it can model ignorance explicitly,

this paper, we propose a new method to analyze the massive volume of messages
available in Twitter to identify places in the world where topics such as TV

is based on a neural network that is used to detect outliers from a time

identify topics within an abnormal behavior in Twitter. The effectiveness of
our method is evaluated in an online environment indicating new findings on

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.5477v2.pdf>Optimal Weighting of Multi-View Data with Low Dimensional Hidden States</a></h2>
<p>  In Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, data often has the following two
properties: First, data can be chopped into multi-views which has been
successfully used for dimension reduction purposes. For example, in topic
classification, every paper can be chopped into the title, the main text and
the references. However, it is common that some of the views are less noisier
than other views for supervised learning problems. Second, unlabeled data are
easy to obtain while labeled data are relatively rare. For example, articles
occurred on New York Times in recent 10 years are easy to grab but having them
classified as 'Politics', 'Finance' or 'Sports' need human labor. Hence less
noisy features are preferred before running supervised learning methods. In
this paper we propose an unsupervised algorithm which optimally weights
features from different views when these views are generated from a low
dimensional hidden state, which occurs in widely used models like Mixture
Gaussian Model, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA).

<p>  Despite recent advances in uncovering the quantitative features of stationary
human activity patterns, many applications, from pandemic prediction to
emergency response, require an understanding of how these patterns change when
the population encounters unfamiliar conditions. To explore societal response
to external perturbations we identified real-time changes in communication and
mobility patterns in the vicinity of eight emergencies, such as bomb attacks
and earthquakes, comparing these with eight non-emergencies, like concerts and
sporting events. We find that communication spikes accompanying emergencies are
both spatially and temporally localized, but information about emergencies
spreads globally, resulting in communication avalanches that engage in a
significant manner the social network of eyewitnesses. These results offer a
quantitative view of behavioral changes in human activity under extreme
conditions, with potential long-term impact on emergency detection and
response.

ranking of multilingual Wikipedia articles. With three ranking algorithms based
on network structure of Wikipedia, we assign ranking to all articles in 9
multilingual editions of Wikipedia and investigate general ranking structure of
PageRank, CheiRank and 2DRank. In particular, we focus on articles related to
persons, identify top 30 persons for each rank among different editions and
analyze distinctions of their distributions over activity fields such as
politics, art, science, religion, sport for each edition. We find that local
heroes are dominant but also global heroes exist and create an effective
network representing entanglement of cultures. The Google matrix analysis of
network of cultures shows signs of the Zipf law distribution. This approach
allows to examine diversity and shared characteristics of knowledge
organization between cultures. The developed computational, data driven
approach highlights cultural interconnections in a new perspective.

practitioners to employ a recently proposed neuromuscular model in actual
training program design. The first novelty concerns the monitoring aspect of
coaching. A method for extracting training performance characteristics from
loosely constrained video sequences, effortlessly and with minimal human input,
using computer vision is described. The extracted data is subsequently used to
fit the underlying neuromuscular model. This is achieved by solving an inverse
dynamics problem corresponding to a particular exercise. Lastly, a computer
simulation of hypothetical training bouts, using athlete-specific capability
parameters, is used to predict the effected adaptation and changes in
performance. The software described here allows the practitioner to manipulate
hypothetical training parameters and immediately see their effect on predicted
adaptation for a specific athlete. Thus, this work presents a holistic view of

POSLDA simultaneously uncovers short-range syntactic patterns (syntax) and
long-range semantic patterns (topics) that exist in document collections. This

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1442v1.pdf>Optimal strategies for throwing accurately</a></h2>
<p>  Accuracy of throwing in games and sports is governed by how errors at
projectile release are propagated by flight dynamics. To address the question
of what governs the choice of throwing strategy, we use a simple model of
throwing with an arm modelled as a hinged bar of fixed length that can release
a projectile at any angle and angular velocity. We show that the amplification
of deviations in launch parameters from a one parameter family of solution
curves is quantified by the largest singular value of an appropriate Jacobian.
This allows us to predict a preferred throwing style in terms of this singular
value, which itself depends on target location and the target shape. Our
analysis also allows us to characterize the trade-off between speed and
accuracy despite not including any effects of signal-dependent noise. Using
nonlinear calculations for propagating finite input-noise, we find that an
underarm throw to a target leads to an undershoot, but an overarm throw does
not. Finally, we consider the limit of the arm-length vanishing, i.e. shooting
a projectile, and find that the most accurate shooting angle bifurcates as the
ratio of the relative noisiness of the initial conditions crosses a threshold.

<p>  The non-scientific event of a soccer match is analysed on a strictly
scientific level. The analysis is based on the recently introduced concept of a
team fitness (Eur. Phys. J. B 67, 445, 2009) and requires the use of
finite-size scaling. A uniquely defined function is derived which
quantitatively predicts the expected average outcome of a soccer match in terms
of the fitness of both teams. It is checked whether temporary fitness
fluctuations of a team hamper the predictability of a soccer match.
  To a very good approximation scoring goals during a match can be
characterized as independent Poissonian processes with pre-determined
expectation values. Minor correlations give rise to an increase of the number
of draws. The non-Poissonian overall goal distribution is just a consequence of
the fitness distribution among different teams. The limits of predictability of
soccer matches are quantified. Our model-free classification of the underlying
ingredients determining the outcome of soccer matches can be generalized to

for announcing a secret message in public place. It can be extended to other
means such as electronic advertising board around sports stadium, railway

denoted by $1,...,n$. We assume that information is generated in a way
correlated with $\pi$. The goal is to find a maximum likelihood $\pi^*$ given
the information observed. We will consider two different types of observations:
noisy comparisons and noisy orders. The data in Noisy orders are permutations
given from an exponential distribution correlated with \pi (this is also called
the Mallow's model). The data in Noisy Comparisons is a signal given for each
pair of elements which is correlated with their true ordering.
  In this paper we present polynomial time algorithms for solving both problems
with high probability. As part of our proof we show that for both models the
maximum likelihood solution $\pi^{\ast}$ is close to the original permutation
$\pi$.
  Our results are of interest in applications to ranking, such as ranking in

<p>  Optimizing the performance of a basketball offense may be viewed as a network
problem, wherein each play represents a "pathway" through which the ball and

Effective field goal percentages from the resulting shot attempts can be used
to characterize the efficiency of each pathway. Inspired by recent discussions
of the "price of anarchy" in traffic networks, this paper makes a formal
analogy between a basketball offense and a simplified traffic network. The
analysis suggests that there may be a significant difference between taking the
highest-percentage shot each time down the court and playing the most efficient
possible game. There may also be an analogue of Braess's Paradox in basketball,
such that removing a key player from a team can result in the improvement of

the considered Painlev\'e equation. In this work we won't consider these
conditions and the existence issue is solved \emph{on line} as follows: If the
input equation is known then it suffices to specialize the change of
coordinates on this equation and test by simple substitution if the equivalence
holds. The other innovation of this work lies in the exploitation of discrete
symmetries for solving the equivalence problem.

<p>  We present a quantitative analysis of throwing ability for major league
outfielders and catchers. We use detailed game event data to tabulate success
and failure events in outfielder and catcher throwing opportunities. We
attribute a run contribution to each success or failure which are tabulated for
each player in each season. We use four seasons of data to estimate the overall
throwing ability of each player using a Bayesian hierarchical model. This model
allows us to shrink individual player estimates towards an overall population
mean depending on the number of opportunities for each player. We use the
posterior distribution of player abilities from this model to identify players
with significant positive and negative throwing contributions.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0605041v1.pdf>The Effect of Spin on the Flight of a Baseball</a></h2>
<p>  New measurements are presented of the lift on a spinning baseball. The
experiment utilizes a pitching machine to project the baseball horizontally; a
high-speed motion capture system to measure the initial velocity and angular
velocity and to track the trajectory over ~5 m of flight; and a ruler to
measure the total distance traversed by the ball. Speeds in the range v=50-110
mph and spin rates (topspin or backspin)in the range omega=1500-4500 rpm were
utilized, corresponding to Reynold's numbers Re=(1.1-2.4) x 10^5 and spin
parameters R*omega/v=0.1-0.6. Standard least-squares fitting procedures were
used to extract the initial parameters of the trajectory and to determine the
lift and drag coefficients. Comparison is made with previous measurements or
parametrizations of the lift and drag coefficients, and implications for the
effect of spin on the flight of a long fly ball are discussed.

<p>  We investigated the release angle that maximises the distance attained in a
long soccer throw-in. One male soccer player performed maximum-effort throws
using release angles of between 10 and 60 degrees, and the throws were analysed
using 2-D video. The player's optimum release angle was calculated by
substituting mathematical expressions for the measured relations between
release speed, release height, and release angle into the equations for the
flight of a spherical projectile. We found that the musculoskeletal structure
of the player's body had a strong influence on the optimum release angle. When
using low release angles the player released the ball with a greater release
speed, and because the range of a projectile is strongly dependent on the
release speed, this bias toward low release angles reduced the optimum release
angle to about 30 degrees. Calculations showed that the distance of a throw may
be increased by a few metres by launching the ball with a fast backspin, but
the ball must be launched at a slightly lower release angle.

<p>  Ranking a set of objects from the most dominant one to the least, based on
the results of paired comparisons, proves to be useful in many contexts. Using
the rankings of teams or individuals players in sports to seed tournaments is
an example. The quality of a ranking is often evaluated by the number of
violations, cases in which an object is ranked lower than another that it has
dominated in a comparison, that it contains. A minimum violations ranking (MVR)
method, as its name suggests, searches specifically for rankings that have the
minimum possible number of violations which may or may not be zero. In this
paper, we present a method based on statistical physics that overcomes
conceptual and practical difficulties faced by earlier studies of the problem.

  Evolving Features</a></h2>
<p>  The idea that the success rate of a team increases when playing home is
broadly accepted and documented for a wide variety of sports. Investigations on
the so-called home advantage phenomenon date back to the 70's and every since
has attracted the attention of scholars and sport enthusiasts. These studies
have been mainly focused on identifying the phenomenon and trying to correlate
it with external factors such as crowd noise and referee bias. Much less is
known about the effects of home advantage in the microscopic dynamics of the
game (within the game) or possible team-specific and evolving features of this
phenomenon. Here we present a detailed study of these previous features in the
National Basketball Association (NBA). By analyzing play-by-play events of more
than sixteen thousand games that span thirteen NBA seasons, we have found that
home advantage affects the microscopic dynamics of the game by increasing the
scoring rates and decreasing the time intervals between scores of teams playing
home. We verified that these two features are different among the NBA teams,
for instance, the scoring rate of the Cleveland Cavaliers team is increased
0.16 points per minute (on average the seasons 2004-05 to 2013-14) when playing
home, whereas for the New Jersey Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets) this rate
increases in only 0.04 points per minute. We further observed that these
microscopic features have evolved over time in a non-trivial manner when
analyzing the results team-by-team. However, after averaging over all teams
some regularities emerge; in particular, we noticed that the average
differences in the scoring rates and in the characteristic times (related to
the time intervals between scores) have slightly decreased over time,
suggesting a weakening of the phenomenon.

<p>  During the last sports season a lot of discussion has been generated for the
several, high-profile, "comebacks" that were observed in almost all sports. The
Cavaliers won the championship after being down 3-1 in the NBA final's series,
which was exactly the case for Chicago Cubs and the World Series. The Patriots
won the Super Bowl even though they were trailing by 25 points late in the
third quarter, while more recently FC Barcelona in the top-16 round of
Champions League scored 3 goals during the last 7 minutes of the game
(including stoppage time) against PSG to advance in the tournament. This has
brought the robustness and accuracy of the various probabilistic prediction
models under high scrutiny. In this paper, we discuss some of the issues that
have been brought up in the wake of last year's events and we also develop our
own in-game win probability model for NFL (iWinrNFL). In particular, we build a
simple logistic regression model that utilizes a set of 10 variables to predict
the running win probability of the home team. In order to account for
non-linearities that exist at the final minutes of the game we enhance the
logistic regression model with a radial basis Support Vector Machine model for
the last 3 minutes of the regulation. We train our model using detailed
play-by-play data from the last 8 NFL seasons obtained through the league's
API. Our results indicate that in 74% of the cases iWinrNFL provides an
accurate winner projection, while most importantly the probabilities are
well-calibrated.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08055v1.pdf>Modelling Competitive Sports: Bradley-Terry-l Models for
  Supervised and On-Line Learning of Paired Competition Outcomes</a></h2>
<p>  Prediction and modelling of competitive sports outcomes has received much
recent attention, especially from the Bayesian statistics and machine learning
communities. In the real world setting of outcome prediction, the seminal
\'{E}l\H{o} update still remains, after more than 50 years, a valuable baseline
which is difficult to improve upon, though in its original form it is a
heuristic and not a proper statistical "model". Mathematically, the \'{E}l\H{o}
rating system is very closely related to the Bradley-Terry models, which are
usually used in an explanatory fashion rather than in a predictive supervised
or on-line learning setting.
  Exploiting this close link between these two model classes and some newly
observed similarities, we propose a new supervised learning framework with
close similarities to logistic regression, low-rank matrix completion and
neural networks. Building on it, we formulate a class of structured log-odds
models, unifying the desirable properties found in the above: supervised
probabilistic prediction of scores and wins/draws/losses, batch/epoch and
on-line learning, as well as the possibility to incorporate features in the
prediction, without having to sacrifice simplicity, parsimony of the
Bradley-Terry models, or computational efficiency of \'{E}l\H{o}'s original
approach.
  We validate the structured log-odds modelling approach in synthetic
experiments and English Premier League outcomes, where the added expressivity
yields the best predictions reported in the state-of-art, close to the quality
of contemporary betting odds.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.03063v1.pdf>This House Proves that Debating is Harder than Soccer</a></h2>
<p>  During the last twenty years, a lot of research was conducted on the sport
elimination problem: Given a sports league and its remaining matches, we have
to decide whether a given team can still possibly win the competition, i.e.,
place first in the league at the end. Previously, the computational complexity
of this problem was investigated only for games with two participating teams
per game. In this paper we consider Debating Tournaments and Debating Leagues
in the British Parliamentary format, where four teams are participating in each
game. We prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a given team can win a
Debating League, even if at most two matches are remaining for each team. This
contrasts settings like football where two teams play in each game since there
this case is still polynomial time solvable. We prove our result even for a
fictitious restricted setting with only three teams per game. On the other
hand, for the common setting of Debating Tournaments we show that this problem
is fixed parameter tractable if the parameter is the number of remaining rounds
$k$. This also holds for the practically very important question of whether a
team can still qualify for the knock-out phase of the tournament and the
combined parameter $k + b$ where $b$ denotes the threshold rank for qualifying.
Finally, we show that the latter problem is polynomial time solvable for any
constant $k$ and arbitrary values $b$ that are part of the input.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.2188v4.pdf>Concurrent Bursty Behavior of Social Sensors in Sporting Events</a></h2>
<p>  The advent of social media expands our ability to transmit information and
connect with others instantly, which enables us to behave as "social sensors."
Here, we studied concurrent bursty behavior of Twitter users during major
sporting events to determine their function as social sensors. We show that the
degree of concurrent bursts in tweets (posts) and retweets (re-posts) works as
a strong indicator of winning or losing a game. More specifically, our simple
tweet analysis of Japanese professional baseball games in 2013 revealed that
social sensors can immediately react to positive and negative events through
bursts of tweets, but that positive events are more likely to induce a
subsequent burst of retweets. We also show that these findings hold true across
cultures by analyzing tweets related to Major League Baseball games in 2015.
Furthermore, we demonstrate active interactions among social sensors by
constructing retweet networks during a baseball game. The resulting networks
commonly exhibited user clusters depending on the baseball team, with a
scale-free connectedness that is indicative of a substantial difference in user
popularity as an information source. While previous studies have mainly focused
on bursts of tweets as a simple indicator of a real-world event, the temporal
correlation between tweets and retweets implies unique aspects of social
sensors, offering new insights into human behavior in a highly connected world.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.0693v1.pdf>Scoring Strategies for the Underdog: A general, quantitative method for
  determining optimal sports strategies</a></h2>
<p>  When facing a heavily-favored opponent, an underdog must be willing to assume
greater-than-average risk. In statistical language, one would say that an
underdog must be willing to adopt a strategy whose outcome has a
larger-than-average variance. The difficult question is how much risk a team
should be willing to accept. This is equivalent to asking how much the team
should be willing to sacrifice from its mean score in order to increase the
score's variance. In this paper a general, analytical method is developed for
addressing this question quantitatively. Under the assumption that every play
in a game is statistically independent, both the mean and the variance of a
team's offensive output can be described using the binomial distribution. This
description allows for direct calculations of the winning probability when a
particular strategy is employed, and therefore allows one to calculate optimal
offensive strategies. This paper develops this method for calculating optimal
strategies exactly and then presents a simple heuristic for determining whether
a given strategy should be adopted. A number of interesting and
counterintuitive examples are then explored, including the merits of stalling
for time, the run/pass/Hail Mary choice in American football, and the correct
use of Hack-a-Shaq.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0231v3.pdf>Characterizing the spatial structure of defensive skill in professional
  basketball</a></h2>
<p>  Although basketball is a dualistic sport, with all players competing on both
offense and defense, almost all of the sport's conventional metrics are
designed to summarize offensive play. As a result, player valuations are
largely based on offensive performances and to a much lesser degree on
defensive ones. Steals, blocks and defensive rebounds provide only a limited
summary of defensive effectiveness, yet they persist because they summarize
salient events that are easy to observe. Due to the inefficacy of traditional
defensive statistics, the state of the art in defensive analytics remains
qualitative, based on expert intuition and analysis that can be prone to human
biases and imprecision. Fortunately, emerging optical player tracking systems
have the potential to enable a richer quantitative characterization of
basketball performance, particularly defensive performance. Unfortunately, due
to computational and methodological complexities, that potential remains unmet.
This paper attempts to fill this void, combining spatial and spatio-temporal
processes, matrix factorization techniques and hierarchical regression models
with player tracking data to advance the state of defensive analytics in the
NBA. Our approach detects, characterizes and quantifies multiple aspects of
defensive play in basketball, supporting some common understandings of
defensive effectiveness, challenging others and opening up many new insights
into the defensive elements of basketball.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.6049v1.pdf>Generating Approximate Solutions to the TTP using a Linear Distance
  Relaxation</a></h2>
<p>  In some domestic professional sports leagues, the home stadiums are located
in cities connected by a common train line running in one direction. For these
instances, we can incorporate this geographical information to determine
optimal or nearly-optimal solutions to the n-team Traveling Tournament Problem
(TTP), an NP-hard sports scheduling problem whose solution is a double
round-robin tournament schedule that minimizes the sum total of distances
traveled by all n teams. We introduce the Linear Distance Traveling Tournament
Problem (LD-TTP), and solve it for n=4 and n=6, generating the complete set of
possible solutions through elementary combinatorial techniques. For larger n,
we propose a novel "expander construction" that generates an approximate
solution to the LD-TTP. For n congruent to 4 modulo 6, we show that our
expander construction produces a feasible double round-robin tournament
schedule whose total distance is guaranteed to be no worse than 4/3 times the
optimal solution, regardless of where the n teams are located. This
4/3-approximation for the LD-TTP is stronger than the currently best-known
ratio of 5/3 + epsilon for the general TTP. We conclude the paper by applying
this linear distance relaxation to general (non-linear) n-team TTP instances,
where we develop fast approximate solutions by simply "assuming" the n teams
lie on a straight line and solving the modified problem. We show that this
technique surprisingly generates the distance-optimal tournament on all
benchmark sets on 6 teams, as well as close-to-optimal schedules for larger n,
even when the teams are located around a circle or positioned in
three-dimensional space.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3909v1.pdf>Scheduling Bipartite Tournaments to Minimize Total Travel Distance</a></h2>
<p>  In many professional sports leagues, teams from opposing leagues/conferences
compete against one another, playing inter-league games. This is an example of
a bipartite tournament. In this paper, we consider the problem of reducing the
total travel distance of bipartite tournaments, by analyzing inter-league
scheduling from the perspective of discrete optimization. This research has
natural applications to sports scheduling, especially for leagues such as the
National Basketball Association (NBA) where teams must travel long distances
across North America to play all their games, thus consuming much time, money,
and greenhouse gas emissions. We introduce the Bipartite Traveling Tournament
Problem (BTTP), the inter-league variant of the well-studied Traveling
Tournament Problem. We prove that the 2n-team BTTP is NP-complete, but for
small values of n, a distance-optimal inter-league schedule can be generated
from an algorithm based on minimum-weight 4-cycle-covers. We apply our
theoretical results to the 12-team Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league in
Japan, producing a provably-optimal schedule requiring 42950 kilometres of
total team travel, a 16% reduction compared to the actual distance traveled by
these teams during the 2010 NPB season. We also develop a nearly-optimal
inter-league tournament for the 30-team NBA league, just 3.8% higher than the
trivial theoretical lower bound.

  heavy ion-beam induced luminescence - Application to luminescence degradation
  of a fast plastic scintillator</a></h2>
<p>  We developed a new sub-nanosecond time-resolved instrument to study the
dynamics of UV-visible luminescence under high stopping power heavy ion
irradiation. We applied our instrument, called SPORT, on a fast plastic
scintillator (BC-400) irradiated with 27-MeV Ar ions having high mean
electronic stopping power of 2.6 MeV/\mu m. As a consequence of increasing
permanent radiation damages with increasing ion fluence, our investigations
reveal a degradation of scintillation intensity together with, thanks to the
time-resolved measurement, a decrease in the decay constant of the
scintillator. This combination indicates that luminescence degradation
processes by both dynamic and static quenching, the latter mechanism being
predominant. Under such high density excitation, the scintillation
deterioration of BC-400 is significantly enhanced compared to that observed in
previous investigations, mainly performed using light ions. The observed
non-linear behaviour implies that the dose at which luminescence starts
deteriorating is not independent on particles' stopping power, thus
illustrating that the radiation hardness of plastic scintillators can be
strongly weakened under high excitation density in heavy ion environments.

  School Football on Later Life Cognitive Functioning and Mental Health</a></h2>
<p>  A potential causal relationship between head injuries sustained by NFL
players and later-life neurological decline may have broad implications for
participants in youth and high school football programs. However, brain trauma
risk at the professional level may be different than that at the youth and high
school levels and the long-term effects of participation at these levels is
as-yet unclear. To investigate the effect of playing high school football on
later life depression and cognitive functioning, we propose a retrospective
observational study using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) of
graduates from Wisconsin high schools in 1957.
  We compare 1,153 high school males who played varsity football to 2,751 male
students who did not. 1,951 of the control subjects did not play any sport and
the remaining 800 controls played a non-contact sport. We focus on two primary
outcomes measured at age 65: a composite cognitive outcome measuring verbal
fluency and memory and the modified CES-D depression score. To control for
potential confounders we adjust for pre-exposure covariates such as IQ with
matching and model-based covariate adjustment. We will conduct an ordered
testing procedure that uses all 2,751 controls while controlling for possible
unmeasured differences between students who played sports and those who did
not. We will quantitatively assess the sensitivity of the results to potential
unmeasured confounding. The study will also consider several secondary outcomes
of clinical interest such as aggression and heavy drinking. The rich set of
pre-exposure variables, relatively unbiased sampling, and longitudinal nature
of the WLS dataset make the proposed analysis unique among related studies that
rely primarily on convenience samples of football players with reported
neurological symptoms.

  Coaches of the 20th-21st Centuries</a></h2>
<p>  Our objective is to find the five best college sports coaches of past century
for three different sports. We decided to look at men's basketball, football,
and baseball. We wanted to use an approach that could definitively determine
team skill from the games played, and then use a machine-learning algorithm to
calculate the correct coach skills for each team in a given year. We created a
networks-based model to calculate team skill from historical game data. A
digraph was created for each year in each sport. Nodes represented teams, and
edges represented a game played between two teams. The arrowhead pointed
towards the losing team. We calculated the team skill of each graph using a
right-hand eigenvector centrality measure. This way, teams that beat good teams
will be ranked higher than teams that beat mediocre teams. The eigenvector
centrality rankings for most years were well correlated with tournament
performance and poll-based rankings. We assumed that the relationship between
coach skill $C_s$, player skill $P_s$, and team skill $T_s$ was $C_s \cdot P_s
= T_s$. We then created a function to describe the probability that a given
score difference would occur based on player skill and coach skill. We
multiplied the probabilities of all edges in the network together to find the
probability that the correct network would occur with any given player skill
and coach skill matrix. We was able to determine player skill as a function of
team skill and coach skill, eliminating the need to optimize two unknown
matrices. The top five coaches in each year were noted, and the top coach of
all time was calculated by dividing the number of times that coach ranked in
the yearly top five by the years said coach had been active.

<p>  In this paper we provide an appraisal of the scientific foundations of the
Olympic sport "judo" from a Western perspective, i.e. a biomechanical
reassessment of the basic teaching tools of the foundations of Jigoro Kano's
Kodokan judo. The core of judo functional organization is the triad made up by
the "Kuzushi-Tsukuri-Kake" movement. Kuzushi (unbalance), tsukuri (entry and
proper fitting of Tori's [the actor] body into the position prior to the
throwing phase), and kake (execution of the judo throwing action) occur as one
effective movement without separation. Biomechanical analysis is able to
broaden and deepen these steps proposed by Kan\=o, who for didactic reasons had
separated the whole movement into three steps, as was pointed out previously by
old Japanese biomechanical studies. The results of our biomechanical
reassessment support: The importance of broadening the unbalance concept to the
dynamic situation.Singling out the existence of two classes of paths and
trajectories called "Action Invariants". The first, "General Action
Invariants", are connected to the whole body motion for shortening the distance
in the kuzushi/tsukuri phase; the second one, the "Specific Action Invariants",
are connected to the superior and inferior kinetic chains motion and right
positioning connected to both the kuzushi and tsukuri phases.The existence of
two basic physical principles of throwing in according to a new
classification.In a clear way the basic mechanical steps of all throws, and
also show hidden connections, similarities and differences among judo throwing
techniques, making this reassessment particularly useful from a didactic point
of view. Demonstrate that this biomechanical approach is also able to
understand how new and innovative technical variations are born.Our
reassessment helps clarifying his concept and facilitates teachers and coaches

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.1065v2.pdf>Onset of coherent attitude layers in a population of sports fans</a></h2>
<p>  The aim of this paper was to empirically investigate the behavior of fans,
globally coupled to a common environmental source of information. The
environmental stimuli were given in a form of referee's decisions list. The
sample of fans had to respond on each stimulus by associating points signifying
his/her own opinion, emotion and action that referee's decisions provoke. Data
were fitted by the Brillouin function which was a solution of an adapted model
of quantum statistical physics to social phenomena. Correlation and a principal
component analysis were performed in order to detect any collective behavior of
the social ensemble of fans. Results showed that fans behaved as a system
subject to a phase transition where the neutral state in the opinion, emotional
and action space has been destabilized and a new stable state of coherent
attitudes was formed. The enhancement of fluctuations and the increase of
social susceptibility (responsiveness) to referee's decisions were connected to
the first few decisions. The subsequent reduction of values in these parameters
signified the onset of coherent layering within the attitude space of the
social ensemble of fans. In the space of opinions fan coherence was maximal as
only one layer of coherence emerged. In the emotional and action spaces the
number of coherent levels was 2 and 4 respectively. The principal component
analysis revealed a strong collective behavior and a high degree of integration
within and between the opinion, emotional and action spaces of the sample of
fans. These results point to one possible way of how different proto-groups,
violent and moderate, may be formed as a consequence of global coupling to a
common source of information.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.2060v3.pdf>Complementary cooperation, minimal winning coalitions, and power indices</a></h2>
<p>  We introduce a new simple game, which is referred to as the complementary
weighted multiple majority game (C-WMMG for short). C-WMMG models a basic
cooperation rule, the complementary cooperation rule, and can be taken as a
sister model of the famous weighted majority game (WMG for short). In this
paper, we concentrate on the two dimensional C-WMMG. An interesting property of
this case is that there are at most $n+1$ minimal winning coalitions (MWC for
short), and they can be enumerated in time $O(n\log n)$, where $n$ is the
number of players. This property guarantees that the two dimensional C-WMMG is
more handleable than WMG. In particular, we prove that the main power indices,
i.e. the Shapley-Shubik index, the Penrose-Banzhaf index, the Holler-Packel
index, and the Deegan-Packel index, are all polynomially computable. To make a
comparison with WMG, we know that it may have exponentially many MWCs, and none
of the four power indices is polynomially computable (unless P=NP). Still for
the two dimensional case, we show that local monotonicity holds for all of the
four power indices. In WMG, this property is possessed by the Shapley-Shubik
index and the Penrose-Banzhaf index, but not by the Holler-Packel index or the
Deegan-Packel index. Since our model fits very well the cooperation and
competition in team sports, we hope that it can be potentially applied in
measuring the values of players in team sports, say help people give more
objective ranking of NBA players and select MVPs, and consequently bring new
insights into contest theory and the more general field of sports economics. It
may also provide some interesting enlightenments into the design of
non-additive voting mechanisms. Last but not least, the threshold version of
C-WMMG is a generalization of WMG, and natural variants of it are closely
related with the famous airport game and the stable marriage/roommates problem.

We consider that two teams compete when they change their relative positions in
consecutive rankings. This allows to define a graph by linking teams that
compete. We show how to use some structural properties of this competitivity
graph to measure to what extend the teams in a league compete. These structural
properties are the mean degree, the mean strength and the clustering
coefficient. We give a generalization of the Kendall's correlation coefficient
to more than two rankings. We also show how to make a dynamic analysis of a

<p>  In most professional sports, the structure of the environment is kept neutral
so that scoring imbalances may be attributed to differences in team skill. It
thus remains unknown what impact structural heterogeneities can have on scoring
dynamics and producing competitive advantages. Applying a generative model of
scoring dynamics to roughly 10 million team competitions drawn from an online
game, we quantify the relationship between a competition's structure and its
scoring dynamics. Despite wide structural variations, we find the same
three-phase pattern in the tempo of events observed in many sports. Tempo and
balance are highly predictable from a competition's structural features alone
and teams exploit environmental heterogeneities for sustained competitive
advantage. The most balanced competitions are associated with specific
environmental heterogeneities, not from equally skilled teams. These results
shed new light on the principles of balanced competition, and illustrate the
potential of online game data for investigating social dynamics and

associated with a news site is likely to post comments on diverse topics (e.g.,

for NBA and MLB players. In the analysis of MLB data, we use functional
principal components analysis (fPCA) to perform functional hypothesis testing
and show differences in aging curves between potential power hitters and
potential non-power hitters. The analysis of aging curves in NBA players
illustrates the use of the PACE method. We show that there are three distinct
aging patterns among NBA players and that player scoring ability differs across
the patterns. We also show that aging pattern is independent of position.

<p>  Ranking a vector of alternatives on the basis of a series of paired
comparisons is a relevant topic in many instances. A popular example is ranking
contestants in sport tournaments. To this purpose, paired comparison models
such as the Bradley-Terry model are often used. This paper suggests fitting
paired comparison models with a lasso-type procedure that forces contestants
with similar abilities to be classified into the same group. Benefits of the
proposed method are easier interpretation of rankings and a significant
improvement of the quality of predictions with respect to the standard maximum
likelihood fitting. Numerical aspects of the proposed method are discussed in
detail. The methodology is illustrated through ranking of the teams of the
National Football League 2010-2011 and the American College Hockey Men's
Division I 2009-2010.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.4724v1.pdf>Randomness in Competitions</a></h2>
<p>  We study the effects of randomness on competitions based on an elementary
random process in which there is a finite probability that a weaker team upsets
a stronger team. We apply this model to sports leagues and sports tournaments,
and compare the theoretical results with empirical data. Our model shows that
single-elimination tournaments are efficient but unfair: the number of games is
proportional to the number of teams N, but the probability that the weakest
team wins decays only algebraically with N. In contrast, leagues, where every
team plays every other team, are fair but inefficient: the top $\sqrt{N}$ of
teams remain in contention for the championship, while the probability that the
weakest team becomes champion is exponentially small. We also propose a gradual
elimination schedule that consists of a preliminary round and a championship
round. Initially, teams play a small number of preliminary games, and
subsequently, a few teams qualify for the championship round. This algorithm is
fair and efficient: the best team wins with a high probability and the number
of games scales as $N^{9/5}$, whereas traditional leagues require N^3 games to
fairly determine a champion.

<p>  Left-handedness is known to provide an intrinsic and tactical advantage at
top level in many sports involving interactive contests. Again, most of the
renowned leaders of the world are known to have been left-handed. Leadership
plays an important role in politics, sports and mentorship. In this paper we
show that Cricket captains who bat left-handed have a strategic advantage over
the right-handed captains in One Day International (ODI) and Test matches. The
present study involving 46 left-handed captains and 148 right-handed captains
in ODI matches, reveal a strong relation between leader's laterality and
team-member performance, demonstrating the critical importance of
left-handedness and successful leadership. The odds for superior batting
performance in an ODI match under left-handed captains are 89% higher than the
odds under right-handed captains. Our study shows that left-handed captains are
more successful in extracting superior performance from the batsmen and bowlers
in ODI and Test matches; perhaps indicating left-handed leaders are better
motivators as leaders when compared to right-handed captains.

<p>  A manually time-measuring tool in mass sporting competitions cannot be
imagined nowadays because many modern disciplines, such as IronMan, take a long
time and, therefore, demand additional reliability. Moreover, automatic timing
devices, based on RFID technology, have become cheaper. However, these devices
cannot operate stand-alone because they need a computer measuring system that
is capable of processing the incoming events, encoding the results, assigning
them to the correct competitor, sorting the results according to the achieved

domain-specific language EasyTime is presented, which enables the controlling
of an agent by writing the events in a database. In particular, we are focused
on the implementation of EasyTime with a LISA tool that enables the automatic
construction of compilers from language specifications using Attribute
Grammars. By using of EasyTime, we can also decrease the number of measuring
devices. Furthermore, EasyTime is universal and can be applied to many

<p>  This paper explores the real-time summarization of scheduled events such as
soccer games from torrential flows of Twitter streams. We propose and evaluate
an approach that substantially shrinks the stream of tweets in real-time, and
consists of two steps: (i) sub-event detection, which determines if something
new has occurred, and (ii) tweet selection, which picks a representative tweet
to describe each sub-event. We compare the summaries generated in three
languages for all the soccer games in "Copa America 2011" to reference live
reports offered by Yahoo! Sports journalists. We show that simple text analysis
methods which do not involve external knowledge lead to summaries that cover
84% of the sub-events on average, and 100% of key types of sub-events (such as
goals in soccer). Our approach should be straightforwardly applicable to other
kinds of scheduled events such as other sports, award ceremonies, keynote

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.2825v2.pdf>Random Walk Picture of Basketball Scoring</a></h2>
<p>  We present evidence, based on play-by-play data from all 6087 games from the
2006/07--2009/10 seasons of the National Basketball Association (NBA), that
basketball scoring is well described by a weakly-biased continuous-time random
walk. The time between successive scoring events follows an exponential
distribution, with little memory between different scoring intervals. Using
this random-walk picture that is augmented by features idiosyncratic to
basketball, we account for a wide variety of statistical properties of scoring,
such as the distribution of the score difference between opponents and the
fraction of game time that one team is in the lead. By further including the
heterogeneity of team strengths, we build a computational model that accounts
for essentially all statistical features of game scoring data and season
win/loss records of each team.

Indeed, NE translation allows the access to multilingual in-formation. This

  Opportunities and Challenges, Risk and Rewards</a></h2>
<p>  Drawing from todays best-in-class solutions, we identify power-saving
strategies that have succeeded in the past and look forward to new ideas and
paradigms. We strongly believe that designing energy-efficient network
equipment can be compared to building sports cars, task-oriented, focused and
fast. However, unlike track-bound sports cars, ultra-fast and purpose-built
silicon yields better energy efficiency when compared to more generic family
sedan designs that mitigate go-to-market risks by being the masters of many
tasks. Thus, we demonstrate that the best opportunities for power savings come
via protocol simplification, best-of-breed technology, and silicon and software
optimization, to achieve the least amount of processing necessary to move
packets. We also look to the future of networking from a new angle, where
energy efficiency and environmental concerns are viewed as fundamental design
criteria and forces that need to be harnessed to continually create more

Starting from the optimization of more simple sports, optimization of this kind

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.3058v2.pdf>Universality, limits and predictability of gold-medal performances at
  the Olympic Games</a></h2>
<p>  Inspired by the Games held in ancient Greece, modern Olympics represent the
world's largest pageant of athletic skill and competitive spirit. Performances
of athletes at the Olympic Games mirror, since 1896, human potentialities in
sports, and thus provide an optimal source of information for studying the
evolution of sport achievements and predicting the limits that athletes can
reach. Unfortunately, the models introduced so far for the description of
athlete performances at the Olympics are either sophisticated or unrealistic,
and more importantly, do not provide a unified theory for sport performances.
Here, we address this issue by showing that relative performance improvements
of medal winners at the Olympics are normally distributed, implying that the
evolution of performance values can be described in good approximation as an
exponential approach to an a priori unknown limiting performance value. This
law holds for all specialties in athletics-including running, jumping, and
throwing-and swimming. We present a self-consistent method, based on normality
hypothesis testing, able to predict limiting performance values in all
specialties. We further quantify the most likely years in which athletes will
breach challenging performance walls in running, jumping, throwing, and
swimming events, as well as the probability that new world records will be
established at the next edition of the Olympic Games.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.2919v1.pdf>Universal scaling in sports ranking</a></h2>
<p>  Ranking is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the human society. By clicking the web
pages of Forbes, you may find all kinds of rankings, such as world's most
powerful people, world's richest people, top-paid tennis stars, and so on and
so forth. Herewith, we study a specific kind, sports ranking systems in which
players' scores and prize money are calculated based on their performances in
attending various tournaments. A typical example is tennis. It is found that
the distributions of both scores and prize money follow universal power laws,
with exponents nearly identical for most sports fields. In order to understand
the origin of this universal scaling we focus on the tennis ranking systems. By
checking the data we find that, for any pair of players, the probability that
the higher-ranked player will top the lower-ranked opponent is proportional to
the rank difference between the pair. Such a dependence can be well fitted to a
sigmoidal function. By using this feature, we propose a simple toy model which
can simulate the competition of players in different tournaments. The
simulations yield results consistent with the empirical findings. Extensive
studies indicate the model is robust with respect to the modifications of the
minor parts.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.1292v1.pdf>A Stochastic Analysis of some Two-Person Sports</a></h2>
<p>  We consider two-person sports where each rally is initiated by a
\emph{server}, the other player (the \emph{receiver}) becoming the server when
he/she wins a rally. Historically, these sports used a scoring based on the
\emph{side-out scoring system}, in which points are only scored by the server.
Recently, however, some federations have switched to the \emph{rally-point
scoring system} in which a point is scored on every rally. As various authors
before us, we study how much this change affects the game. Our approach is
based on a \emph{rally-level analysis} of the process through which, besides
the well-known probability distribution of the scores, we also obtain the
distribution of the number of rallies. This yields a comprehensive knowledge of
the process at hand, and allows for an in-depth comparison of both scoring
systems. In particular, our results {help} to explain why the transition from
one scoring system to the other has more important implications than those
predicted from game-winning probabilities alone. Some of our findings are quite
surprising, and unattainable through Monte Carlo experiments. Our results are
of high practical relevance to international federations and local tournament
organizers alike, and also open the way to efficient estimation of the
rally-winning probabilities, which should have a significant impact on the
quality of ranking procedures.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7474v1.pdf>The phenotypic expansion and its boundaries</a></h2>
<p>  The development of sport performances in the future is a subject of myth and
disagreement among experts. As arguments favoring and opposing such methodology
were discussed, other publications empirically showed that the past development
of performances followed a non linear trend. Other works, while deeply
exploring the conditions leading to world records, highlighted that performance
is tied to the economical and geopolitical context. Here we investigated the
following human boundaries: development of performances with time in Olympic
and non-Olympic events, development of sport performances with aging among
humans and others species (greyhounds, thoroughbreds, mice). Development of
performances from a broader point of view (demography & lifespan) in a specific
sub-system centered on primary energy was also investigated. We show that the
physiological developments are limited with time. Three major and direct
determinants of sport performance are age, technology and climatic conditions
(temperature). However, all observed developments are related to the
international context including the efficient use of primary energies. This
last parameter is a major indirect propeller of performance development. We
show that when physiological and societal performance indicators such as
lifespan and population density depend on primary energies, the energy source,
competition and mobility are key parameters for achieving long term sustainable
trajectories. Otherwise, the vast majority (98.7%) of the studied trajectories
reaches 0 before 15 generations, due to the consumption of fossil energy and a
low mobility rate. This led us to consider that in the present turbulent
economical context and given the upcoming energy crisis, societal and physical
performances are not expected to grow continuously.

That is, $n$ games are held simultaneously in a day. We want to make a schedule
which has $n(2n-1)$ games for $2n-1$ days.
  When we make a schedule, the schedule must satisfy a constraint according to
the HAP table, which designates a home game or an away game for each team and
each date. Two teams cannot play against each other unless one team is assigned
to a home game and the other team is assigned to an away game. Recently, D.
Briskorn proposed a necessary condition for a HAP table to have a proper
schedule. And he proposed a conjecture that such a condition is also
sufficient. That is, if a solution to the linear inequalities exists, they must
have an integral solution. In this paper, we rewrite his conjecture by using
perfect matchings. We consider a monoid in the affine space generated by
perfect matchings. In terms of the Hilbert basis of such a monoid, the problem
is naturally generalized to a scheduling problem for not all pairs of teams
described by a regular graph. In this paper, we show a regular graph such that
the corresponding linear inequalities have a solution but do not have any
integral solution. Moreover we discuss for which regular graphs the statement
generalizing the conjecture holds.

increases the chance of winning by a small ($\sim$ 2.8\%) but significant
margin. The advantage varies heftily and systematically, by how closely matched
the competing teams are, and by playing conditions---tautologically, winning
the toss in conditions where the toss grants a greater advantage, for e.g., in

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.2228v2.pdf>A network-based dynamical ranking system for competitive sports</a></h2>
<p>  From the viewpoint of networks, a ranking system for players or teams in
sports is equivalent to a centrality measure for sports networks, whereby a
directed link represents the result of a single game. Previously proposed
network-based ranking systems are derived from static networks, i.e.,
aggregation of the results of games over time. However, the score of a player
(or team) fluctuates over time. Defeating a renowned player in the peak
performance is intuitively more rewarding than defeating the same player in
other periods. To account for this factor, we propose a dynamic variant of such
a network-based ranking system and apply it to professional men's tennis data.
We derive a set of linear online update equations for the score of each player.
The proposed ranking system predicts the outcome of the future games with a
higher accuracy than the static counterparts.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4735v1.pdf>Realignment in the NHL, MLB, the NFL, and the NBA</a></h2>
<p>  Sports leagues consist of conferences subdivided into divisions. Teams play a

different divisions and conferences. Usually, a league structure remains stable
from one season to the next. However, structures change when growth or
contraction occurs, and realignment of the four major professional sports
leagues in North America has occurred more than twenty-five times since 1967.
In this paper, we describe a method for realigning sports leagues that is
flexible, adaptive, and that enables construction of schedules that minimize
travel while satisfying other criteria. We do not build schedules; we develop
league structures which support the subsequent construction of efficient
schedules. Our initial focus is the NHL, which has an urgent need for
realignment following the recent move of the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg, but
our methods can be adapted to virtually any situation. We examine a variety of
scenarios for the NHL, and apply our methods to the NBA, MLB, and NFL. We find
the biggest improvements for MLB and the NFL, where adopting the best solutions
would reduce league travel by about 20%.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00583v1.pdf>A PageRank Model for Player Performance Assessment in Basketball, Soccer

<p>  In the sports of soccer, hockey and basketball the most commonly used
statistics for player performance assessment are divided into two categories:
offensive statistics and defensive statistics. However, qualitative assessments
of playmaking (for example making "smart" passes) are difficult to quantify. It
would be advantageous to have available a single statistic that can emphasize
the flow of a game, rewarding those players who initiate and contribute to
successful plays more. In this paper we will examine a model based on Google's
PageRank. Other papers have explored ranking teams, coaches, and captains but
here we construct ratings and rankings for individual members on both teams
that emphasizes initiating and partaking in successful plays and forcing
defensive turnovers. For a soccer/hockey/basketball game, our model assigns a
node for each of the n players who play in the game and a "goal node". Arcs
between player nodes indicate sport-specific situations (including passes,
turnovers, scoring, fouls, out-of-bounds, play-stoppages, turnovers, missed
shots, defensive plays etc.), tailored for each sport. As well, some additional
arcs are added in to ensure that the associated matrix is primitive and hence
there is a unique PageRank vector. The PageRank vector of the associated matrix
is used to rank the players of the game. To illustrate the model, data was
taken from nine NBA games played between 2014-2016. Many of the top-ranked
players (in the model) in a given game had some of the most impressive
traditional stat-lines. However, from the model there were surprises where some
players who had impressive stat-lines had lower ranks, and others who had less
impressive stat-lines had higher ranks. Overall, the model's ranking and
ratings reflect more the flow of the game compared to traditional sports
statistics.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04153v1.pdf>Universal temporal features of rankings in competitive sports and games</a></h2>
<p>  Many complex phenomena, from the selection of traits in biological systems to
hierarchy formation in social and economic entities, show signs of competition
and heterogeneous performance in the temporal evolution of their components,
which may eventually lead to stratified structures such as the wealth
distribution worldwide. However, it is still unclear whether the road to
hierarchical complexity is determined by the particularities of each phenomena,
or if there are universal mechanisms of stratification common to many systems.
Human sports and games, with their (varied but simplified) rules of competition
and measures of performance, serve as an ideal test bed to look for universal
features of hierarchy formation. With this goal in mind, we analyse here the
behaviour of players and team rankings over time for several sports and games.
Even though, for a given time, the distribution of performance ranks varies
across activities, we find statistical regularities in the dynamics of ranks.
Specifically the rank diversity, a measure of the number of elements occupying
a given rank over a length of time, has the same functional form in sports and
games as in languages, another system where competition is determined by the

hierarchical phenomena may be driven by the same underlying mechanisms of rank
formation, regardless of the nature of their components. Moreover, such
regularities can in principle be used to predict lifetimes of rank occupancy,
thus increasing our ability to forecast stratification in the presence of
competition.

<p>  Predicting the results of sport matches and competitions is an arising
research field, benefiting from the growing amount of available data and the
novel data analytics techniques. Excellent forecasts can be achieved by
advanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data,
especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that,
despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football team
in longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically linear
trend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we present
a set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearly
results of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 football
seasons.

<p>  In electronic sports, cyberathletes conceal their online training using
different avatars (virtual identities), allowing them not being recognized by
the opponents they may face in future competitions. In this article, we propose
a method to tackle this avatar aliases identification problem. Our method
trains a classifier on behavioural data and processes the confusion matrix to
output label pairs which concentrate confusion. We experimented with Starcraft

throwing games. We show that we can decide how to manipulate round robin and
cup competitions, two of the most popular types of sporting competitions in
polynomial time. In addition, we show that finding the minimal number of games
that need to be thrown to manipulate the result can also be determined in
polynomial time. Finally, we show that there are several different variations
of standard cup competitions where manipulation remains polynomial.

  Tournament Problem</a></h2>
<p>  The Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP) is a benchmark problem in sports
scheduling and has been extensively studied in recent years. The Mirrored
Traveling Tournament Problem (mTTP) is variation of the TTP that represents
certain types of sports scheduling problems where the main objective is to
minimize the total distance traveled by all the participating teams. In this
paper we test a parallel simulated annealing approach for solving the mTTP
using OpenMP on shared memory systems and we found that this approach is
superior especially with respect to the number of solution instances that are
probed per second. We also see that there is significant speed up of 1.5x -
2.2x in terms of number of solutions explored per unit time.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.1972v1.pdf>Archetypal Athletes</a></h2>
<p>  Discussions on outstanding---positively and/or negatively---athletes are
common practice. The rapidly grown amount of collected sports data now allow to
support such discussions with state of the art statistical methodology. Given a
(multivariate) data set with collected data of athletes within a specific
sport, outstanding athletes are values on the data set boundary. In the present
paper we propose archetypal analysis to compute these extreme values. The
so-called archetypes, i.e., archetypal athletes, approximate the observations
as convex combinations. We interpret the archetypal athletes and their
characteristics, and, furthermore, the composition of all athletes based on the
archetypal athletes. The application of archetypal analysis is demonstrated on
basketball statistics and soccer skill ratings.

  analysis: evidence from Russian football</a></h2>
<p>  Increasing investments into various dimensions of sports draw a significant
amount of attention to the way these resources are being managed and which
organizations achieve development goals with higher efficiency. This paper
reviews the methodology of designing an efficiency rating model for assessing
sports entities, focusing on the experience of Russian football. The Russian
Regional Efficiency of Football Development model aims to evaluate the regional
federations of the Football Union of Russian via 5 dimensions. The scoring
method of the model is based on the three-sigma rule of distribution. Support
factors in the form of population density and climate were also included, since
Russian regions significantly differentiate in these aspects. The findings of
this paper showcased that not a single region was able to achieve a maximum 5-
star rating, while regions set to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup did not score
better compared to others. In conclusion the authors provide various
suggestions on further developing and implementing rating models within global
sports organizations.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09830v1.pdf>Meta-Analytics: Tools for Understanding the Statistical Properties of
  Sports Metrics</a></h2>
<p>  In sports, there is a constant effort to improve metrics which assess player
ability, but there has been almost no effort to quantify and compare existing
metrics. Any individual making a management, coaching, or gambling decision is
quickly overwhelmed with hundreds of statistics. We address this problem by
proposing a set of "meta-metrics" which can be used to identify the metrics
that provide the most unique, reliable, and useful information for
decision-makers. Specifically, we develop methods to evalute metrics based on
three criteria: 1) stability: does the metric measure the same thing over time
2) discrimination: does the metric differentiate between players and 3)
independence: does the metric provide new information? Our methods are easy to
implement and widely applicable so they should be of interest to the broader
sports community. We demonstrate our methods in analyses of both NBA and NHL
metrics. Our results indicate the most reliable metrics and highlight how they
should be used by sports analysts. The meta-metrics also provide useful
insights about how to best construct new metrics which provide independent and
reliable information about athletes.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03509v1.pdf>Safe Leads and Lead Changes in Competitive Team Sports</a></h2>
<p>  We investigate the time evolution of lead changes within individual games of
competitive team sports. Exploiting ideas from the theory of random walks, the
number of lead changes within a single game follows a Gaussian distribution. We
show that the probability that the last lead change and the time of the largest
lead size are governed by the same arcsine law, a bimodal distribution that
diverges at the start and at the end of the game. We also determine the
probability that a given lead is "safe" as a function of its size $L$ and game
time $t$. Our predictions generally agree with comprehensive data on more than
1.25 million scoring events in roughly 40,000 games across four professional or
semi-professional team sports, and are more accurate than popular heuristics
currently used in sports analytics.

<p>  In order to address complex systems, apply pattern recongnition on their
evolution could play an key role to understand their dynamics. Global patterns
are required to detect emergent concepts and trends, some of them with
qualitative nature. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a theory whose goal is to
discover and to extract Knowledge from qualitative data. It provides tools for
reasoning with implication basis (and association rules). Implications and
association rules are usefull to reasoning on previously selected attributes,
providing a formal foundation for logical reasoning. In this paper we analyse
how to apply FCA reasoning to increase confidence in sports betting, by means
of detecting temporal regularities from data. It is applied to build a
Knowledge-Based system for confidence reasoning.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.05976v1.pdf>How often does the best team win? A unified approach to understanding
  randomness in North American sport</a></h2>
<p>  Statistical applications in sports have long centered on how to best separate
signal, such as team talent, from random noise. However, most of this work has
concentrated on a single sport, and the development of meaningful cross-sport
comparisons has been impeded by the difficulty of translating luck from one
sport to another. In this manuscript, we use betting market data to develop a
Bayesian state-space model that can be uniformly applied across sporting
leagues to better understand the role of randomness in game outcomes. Our model
can be used to extract estimates of team strength, the between-season,
within-season, and game-to-game variability of team strengths, as well each
team's home advantage. We implement our approach across a decade of play in
each of the National Football League (NFL), National Hockey League (NHL),
National Basketball Association (NBA), and Major League Baseball (MLB), finding
that the NBA demonstrates both the largest dispersion in talent and the largest
home advantage. Additionally, the NHL and MLB stand out for their relative
randomness in game outcomes. We conclude by proposing a new metric for judging
league competitiveness that works in absence of factors outside of team
control.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.07179v1.pdf>Who's good this year? Comparing the Information Content of Games in the
  Four Major US Sports</a></h2>
<p>  In the four major North American professional sports (baseball, basketball,
football, and hockey), the primary purpose of the regular season is to
determine which teams most deserve to advance to the playoffs. Interestingly,
while the ultimate goal of identifying the best teams is the same, the number
of regular season games played differs dramatically between the sports, ranging
from 16 (football) to 82 (basketball and hockey) to 162 (baseball). Though
length of season is partially determined by many factors including travel
logistics, rest requirements, playoff structure and television contracts, it is
hard to reconcile the 10-fold difference in the number of games between, for
example, the NFL and MLB unless football games are somehow more "informative"
than baseball games. In this paper, we aim to quantify the amount of
information games yield about the relative strength of the teams involved. Our
strategy is to assess how well simple paired comparison models fitted from $X%$
of the games within a season predict the outcomes of the remaining $(100-X)%$
of games, for multiple values of $X$. We compare the resulting predictive
accuracy curves between seasons within the same sport and across all four
sports, and find dramatic differences in the amount of information yielded by
individual game results in the four major U.S. sports.

<p>  We present an extensive statistical analysis of the results of all sports
competitions in five major sports leagues in England and the United States. We
characterize the parity among teams by the variance in the winning fraction
from season-end standings data and quantify the predictability of games by the
frequency of upsets from game results data. We introduce a novel mathematical
model in which the underdog team wins with a fixed upset probability. This
model quantitatively relates the parity among teams with the predictability of
the games, and it can be used to estimate the upset frequency from standings
data.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03886v4.pdf>The game story space of professional sports: Australian Rules Football</a></h2>
<p>  Sports are spontaneous generators of stories. Through skill and chance, the
script of each game is dynamically written in real time by players acting out
possible trajectories allowed by a sport's rules. By properly characterizing a
given sport's ecology of `game stories', we are able to capture the sport's
capacity for unfolding interesting narratives, in part by contrasting them with
random walks. Here, we explore the game story space afforded by a data set of
1,310 Australian Football League (AFL) score lines. We find that AFL games
exhibit a continuous spectrum of stories rather than distinct clusters. We show
how coarse-graining reveals identifiable motifs ranging from last minute
comeback wins to one-sided blowouts. Through an extensive comparison with
biased random walks, we show that real AFL games deliver a broader array of
motifs than null models, and we provide consequent insights into the narrative
appeal of real games.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.05872v1.pdf>Predicting sports scoring dynamics with restoration and anti-persistence</a></h2>
<p>  Professional team sports provide an excellent domain for studying the
dynamics of social competitions. These games are constructed with simple,
well-defined rules and payoffs that admit a high-dimensional set of possible
actions and nontrivial scoring dynamics. The resulting gameplay and efforts to
predict its evolution are the object of great interest to both sports
professionals and enthusiasts. In this paper, we consider two online prediction
problems for team sports:~given a partially observed game Who will score next?
and ultimately Who will win? We present novel interpretable generative models
of within-game scoring that allow for dependence on lead size (restoration) and
on the last team to score (anti-persistence). We then apply these models to
comprehensive within-game scoring data for four sports leagues over a ten year
period. By assessing these models' relative goodness-of-fit we shed new light
on the underlying mechanisms driving the observed scoring dynamics of each
sport. Furthermore, in both predictive tasks, the performance of our models
consistently outperforms baselines models, and our models make quantitative
assessments of the latent team skill, over time.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0111009v1.pdf>Complex Systems As Fundamental Theory Of Sports Coaching?</a></h2>
<p>  We argue that traditional Western science cannot adequately describe sports
and other types of human behavior. Then we make an argument why a complex
adaptive systems approach has the potential to provide the foundation for such
a theory. We claim that a special role will be played by biological quantum
computation in the human brain that should have emerged through biological
evolution. Biological quantum computation could have provided evolutionary
advantages in the area of decision-making and fast motor responses, when a
number of potential actions -represented as a set of points in a high
dimensional state-space- are available to the agent. While for animals and
early humans these rapid, coordinated motor activities had direct survival
value, today they are mostly manifested in competitive sports events. We
suggest that entanglement can be facilitated by systematic sports coaching.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04203v2.pdf>Determining Tournament Payout Structures for Daily Fantasy Sports</a></h2>
<p>  With an exploding global market and the recent introduction of online cash
prize tournaments, fantasy sports contests are quickly becoming a central part
of the social gaming and sports industries. For sports fans and online media
companies, fantasy sports contests are an opportunity for large financial
gains. However, they present a host of technical challenges that arise from the
complexities involved in running a web-scale, prize driven fantasy sports
platform.
  We initiate the study of these challenges by examining one concrete problem
in particular: how to algorithmically generate contest payout structures that
are 1) economically motivating and appealing to contestants and 2) reasonably
structured and succinctly representable. We formalize this problem and present
a general two-staged approach for producing satisfying payout structures given
constraints on contest size, entry fee, prize bucketing, etc.
  We then propose and evaluate several potential algorithms for solving the
payout problem efficiently, including methods based on dynamic programming,
integer programming, and heuristic techniques. Experimental results show that a
carefully designed heuristic scales very well, even to contests with over
100,000 prize winners.
  Our approach extends beyond fantasy sports -- it is suitable for generating
engaging payout structures for any contest with a large number of entrants and
a large number of prize winners, including other massive online games, poker
tournaments, and real-life sports tournaments.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.5549v4.pdf>Instant Replay: Investigating statistical Analysis in Sports</a></h2>
<p>  Technology has had an unquestionable impact on the way people watch sports.
Along with this technological evolution has come a higher standard to ensure a
good viewing experience for the casual sports fan. It can be argued that the
pervasion of statistical analysis in sports serves to satiate the fan's desire
for detailed sports statistics. The goal of statistical analysis in sports is a
simple one: to eliminate subjective analysis. In this paper, we review previous
work that attempts to analyze various aspects in sports by using ideas from
Markov Chains, Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
The unifying goal of these works is to achieve an accurate representation of
the player's ability, the sport, or the environmental effects on the player's
performance. With the prevalence of cheap computation, it is possible that
using techniques in Artificial Intelligence could improve the result of
statistical analysis in sport. This is best illustrated when evaluating
football using Neuro Dynamic Programming, a Control Theory paradigm heavily
based on theory in Stochastic processes. The results from this method suggest
that statistical analysis in sports may benefit from using ideas from the area
of Control Theory or Machine Learning

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4461v2.pdf>Scoring dynamics across professional team sports: tempo, balance and
  predictability</a></h2>
<p>  Despite growing interest in quantifying and modeling the scoring dynamics
within professional sports games, relative little is known about what patterns
or principles, if any, cut across different sports. Using a comprehensive data
set of scoring events in nearly a dozen consecutive seasons of college and
professional (American) football, professional hockey, and professional
basketball, we identify several common patterns in scoring dynamics. Across
these sports, scoring tempo---when scoring events occur---closely follows a
common Poisson process, with a sport-specific rate. Similarly, scoring
balance---how often a team wins an event---follows a common Bernoulli process,
with a parameter that effectively varies with the size of the lead. Combining
these processes within a generative model of gameplay, we find they both
reproduce the observed dynamics in all four sports and accurately predict game
outcomes. These results demonstrate common dynamical patterns underlying
within-game scoring dynamics across professional team sports, and suggest
specific mechanisms for driving them. We close with a brief discussion of the
implications of our results for several popular hypotheses about sports
dynamics.
