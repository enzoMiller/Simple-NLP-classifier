<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0403493v1.pdf>Antenna Instrumental Polarization and its Effects on E- and B-Modes for
  CMBP Observations</a></h2>
<p>  We analyze the instrumental polarization generated by the antenna system
(optics and feed horn) due to the unpolarized sky emission. Our equations show
that it is given by the convolution of the unpolarized emission map
$T_b(\theta, \phi)$ with a sort of instrumental polarization beam $\Pi$ defined
by the co- and cross-polar patterns of the antenna. This result is general, it
can be applied to all antenna systems and is valid for all schemes to detect
polarization, like correlation and differential polarimeters. The axisymmetric
case is attractive: it generates an $E$-mode--like $\Pi$ pattern, the
contamination does not depend on the scanning strategy and the instrumental
polarization map does not have $B$-mode contamination, making axisymmetric
systems suitable to detect the faint $B$-mode signal of the Cosmic Microwave
Background Polarization. The $E$-mode of the contamination only affects the
FWHM scales leaving the larger ones significantly cleaner. Our analysis is also
applied to the SPOrt experiment where we find that the contamination of the
$E$-mode is negligible in the $\ell$-range of interest for CMBP large angular
scale investigations (multipole $\ell < 10$).

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0309438v1.pdf>Polarization Measures And Nature Of Dark Energy</a></h2>
<p>  Polarization measures, on wide angular scales, together with anisotropy data,
can fix DE parameters. Here we discuss the sensitivity needed to provide
significant limits. Our analysis puts in evidence that a class of models
predicts low correlation or anticorrelation between polarization and anisotropy
at low l. This class includes open models and models with DE due to a
Ratra--Peebles (RP) potential. Results on this point, given in a previous paper
of ours, are updated and partially corrected. We outline that, with the
sensitivity of experiments like SPOrt or WMAP, high values of Lambda (energy
scale in the RP potential) can be excluded. With the sensitivity expected for
PLANCK, the selection will extend to much lower Lambda's.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0111088v1.pdf>Separation of the Galactic Synchrotron Foreground and the CMB
  Polarization Measurements</a></h2>
<p>  The polarization of the CMBR represents a powerful test for modern cosmology.
It allows to break the degeneracy of fundamental cosmological parameters, and
also to observe the contribution of gravitational waves background to the CMBR
anisotropy. To observe the CMBR polarization several experiments are either in
progress or planned and SPOrt is one of the most promising planned by ESA. At
the same time the observation of the CMBR polarization is a difficult task and
one of the reasons is the presence of polarized foreground emission. For
instance, galactic polarized synchrotron emission (according to some estimates)
can completely mimic the polarization of the CMBR. Nevertheless, one can use
mathematical properties of the spherical harmonics of the distribution of
radiation over the sky to separate different contributions. In this paper the
mathematical properties of the polarized synchrotron foreground and the
physical mechanism that produces it are discussed. The separation of
synchrotron polarization from the polarization generated by density
cosmological perturbations is discussed as well.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9710012v2.pdf>Correlation Functions of CMB Anisotropy and Polarization</a></h2>
<p>  We give a full analysis of the auto- and cross-correlations between the
Stokes parameters of the cosmic microwave background. In particular, we derive
the windowing function for an antenna with Gaussian response in polarization
experiment, and construct correlation function estimators corrected for
instrumental noise. They are applied to calculate the signal to noise ratios
for future anisotropy and polarization measurements. While the
small-angular-scale anisotropy-polarization correlation would be likely
detected by the MAP satellite, the detection of electric and magnetic
polarization would require higher experimental sensitivity. For
large-angular-scale measurements such as the being planned SPOrt/ISS, the
expected signal to noise ratio for polarization is greater than one only for
reionized models with high reionization redshifts, and the ratio is less for
anisotropy-polarization correlation. Correlation and covariance matrices for
likelihood analyses of ground-based and satellite data are also given.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0401193v2.pdf>The Sky Polarization Observatory</a></h2>
<p>  SPOrt is an ASI-funded experiment specifically designed to measure the sky
polarization at 22, 32 and 90 GHz, which was selected in 1997 by ESA to be
flown on the International Space Station. Starting in 2006 and for at least 18
months, it will be taking direct and simultaneous measurements of the Stokes
parameters Q and U at 660 sky pixels, with FWHM=7 degrees. Due to development
efforts over the past few years, the design specifications have been
significantly improved with respect to the first proposal. Here we present an
up-to-date description of the instrument, which now warrants a pixel
sensitivity of 1.7 microK for the polarization of the cosmic background
radiation, assuming two years of observations. We discuss SPOrt scientific
goals in the light of WMAP results, in particular in connection with the
emerging double-reionization cosmological scenario.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0302276v1.pdf>An iterative destriping technique for diffuse background polarization
  data</a></h2>
<p>  We describe a simple but effective iterative procedure specifically designed
to destripe Q and U Stokes parameter data as those collected by the SPOrt
experiment onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The method is general
enough to be useful for other experiments, both in polarization and total
intensity. The only requirement for the algorithm to work properly is that the
receiver knee frequency must be lower than the signal modulation frequency,
corresponding in our case to the ISS orbit period. Detailed performances of the
technique are presented in the context of the SPOrt experiment, both in terms
of added rms noise and residual correlated noise.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0301020v1.pdf>The BaR-SPOrt Experiment</a></h2>
<p>  BaR-SPOrt (Balloon-borne Radiometers for Sky Polarisation Observations) is an
experiment to measure the linearly polarized emission of sky patches at 32 and
90 GHz with sub-degree angular resolution. It is equipped with high sensitivity
correlation polarimeters for simultaneous detection of both the U and Q stokes
parameters of the incident radiation. On-axis telescope is used to observe
angular scales where the expected polarization of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMBP) peaks. This project shares most of the know-how and
sophisticated technology developed for the SPOrt experiment onboard the
International Space Station. The payload is designed to flight onboard long
duration stratospheric balloons both in the Northern and Southern hemispheres
where low foreground emission sky patches are accessible. Due to the weakness
of the expected CMBP signal (in the range of microK), much care has been spent
to optimize the instrument design with respect to the systematics generation,
observing time efficiency and long term stability. In this contribution we
present the instrument design, and first tests on some components of the 32 GHz
radiometer.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0212067v1.pdf>SPOrt: an Experiment Aimed at Measuring the Large Scale Cosmic Microwave
  Background Polarization</a></h2>
<p>  SPOrt (Sky Polarization Observatory) is a space experiment to be flown on the
International Space Station during Early Utilization Phase aimed at measuring
the microwave polarized emission with FWHM = 7deg, in the frequency range 22-90
GHz. The Galactic polarized emission can be observed at the lower frequencies
and the polarization of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) at 90 GHz, where
contaminants are expected to be less important. The extremely low level of the
CMB Polarization signal (< 1 uK) calls for intrinsically stable radiometers.
The SPOrt instrument is expressly devoted to CMB polarization measurements and
the whole design has been optimized for minimizing instrumental polarization
effects. In this contribution we present the receiver architecture based on
correlation techniques, the analysis showing its intrinsic stability and the
custom hardware development carried out to detect such a low signal.

<h2><a href=http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0408498v1.pdf>Effects of Thermal Fluctuations in the SPOrt Experiment</a></h2>
<p>  The role of systematic errors induced by thermal fluctuations is analyzed for
the SPOrt experiment with the aim at estimating their impact on the measurement
of the Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization (CMBP). The transfer functions
of the antenna devices from temperature to data fluctuations are computed, by
writing them in terms of both instrument and thermal environment parameters. In
addition, the corresponding contamination maps are estimated, along with their
polarized power spectra, for different behaviours of the instabilities. The
result is that thermal effects are at a negligible level even for fluctuations
correlated with the Sun illumination provided their frequency $f_{tf}$ is
larger than that of the Sun illumination ($f_{day}$) by a factor $f_{tf} /
f_{day} > 30$, which defines a requirement for the statistical properties of
the temperature behaviour as well. The analysis with actual SPOrt operative
parameters shows that the instrument is only weakly sensitive to temperature
instabilities, the main contribution coming from the cryogenic stage. The
contamination on the E-mode spectrum does not significantly pollute the CMBP
signal and no specific data cleaning seems to be needed.
